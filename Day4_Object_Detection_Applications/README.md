# Day 4 – Applications of Object Detection

This module explores the **real-world applications of object detection** beyond just detecting objects.  
We will connect yesterday’s knowledge (YOLO basics, annotation, finetuning) to **practical use cases** in traffic, safety, and sustainability.

## 📌 Learning Objectives
By the end of Day 4, you will be able to:
- Understand how object detection powers **real-world solutions**  
- Apply YOLO-based detection models to **different application domains**  
- Analyze how detection results translate into **actionable insights** (e.g., counting, monitoring)

## 🧑‍💻 Hands-On Projects
Day 4 consists of **three practical projects**:

1. **Waste Detection**  
   - Detect and classify waste items for smart recycling and sustainability applications.  

2. **Vehicle Counting**  
   - Apply object detection on traffic footage to count vehicles and analyze traffic flow.  

3. **Pedestrian Counting**  
   - Detect and count pedestrians for applications in crowd monitoring and safety management.  

👉 Each project has its own folder with code, datasets (or links), and a README for step-by-step instructions.
